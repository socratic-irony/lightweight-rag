# PDF Text Quality Improvements

This document describes the text quality improvements added to handle PDFs with encoding issues or garbled text extraction.

## Problem

Some PDFs contain text that extracts as control characters or garbled content, such as:
```
\u0000\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0001\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t \u0005\u000b\u0001\u0005\f\b\t\u0005\r\u000e\u000f
```

This happens due to:
- Font encoding issues in the PDF
- Encrypted or protected text
- Scanned documents with poor OCR
- Corrupted PDF files

## Solution

Added comprehensive text quality validation and cleaning in `io_pdf.py`:

### 1. Text Quality Validation (`is_text_quality_good`)

Checks text for:
- **Control characters**: Rejects text with >5% control characters (excluding tabs, newlines)
- **Printable ratio**: Requires â‰¥70% printable characters
- **Repeated patterns**: Detects excessive character repetition (encoding artifacts)
- **Character distribution**: Ensures presence of common letters

### 2. Text Cleaning (`clean_text`)

- Removes null bytes and problematic control characters
- Normalizes Unicode (NFKC normalization)
- Cleans excessive whitespace
- Preserves legitimate formatting characters

### 3. Enhanced PDF Extraction (`extract_pdf_pages`)

Multi-stage extraction process:
1. **Primary extraction**: Standard `page.get_text()`
2. **Quality check**: Validate and clean extracted text
3. **Fallback methods**: If quality is poor, try:
   - TextPage extraction with different options
   - Block-based extraction
4. **Warning system**: Mark problematic pages with `[TEXT_QUALITY_WARNING]`
5. **Filtering**: Skip pages that fail all quality checks

### 4. Configuration Options

Added to `config.yaml`:
```yaml
indexing:
  text_quality_check: true       # Enable text quality validation
  min_readable_ratio: 0.7        # Minimum ratio of readable characters
```

## Results

- Garbled/corrupted pages are automatically filtered out
- Clean, readable text is preserved
- Multiple extraction methods increase success rate
- Warnings help identify problematic source documents

## Testing

Run the text quality test:
```bash
python3 test_text_quality.py
```

This validates the quality detection against various text samples including the original problematic case.

## Impact

- Improved search accuracy by removing noise
- Better citation extraction from clean text
- Reduced false matches from garbled content
- Enhanced overall corpus quality
